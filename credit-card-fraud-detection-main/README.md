# Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### Logistic Regression

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository! This project provides a machine learning solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. Whether you're a financial institution looking to enhance fraud detection capabilities or a data scientist exploring classification algorithms, this project offers insights into building an effective fraud detection system.

## Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the banking and financial sector, aiming to identify fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses. In this project, we leverage logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to analyze transaction data and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.


## Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess credit card transaction data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the transaction data to capture patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud.
3. Logistic Regression: Implement logistic regression algorithm to build a predictive model for fraud detection.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.
5. Real-time Prediction: Deploy the trained model to make real-time predictions on new credit card transactions.
6. Interpretability: Interpret the model coefficients and understand the factors influencing fraud predictions.







    




## Getting Started
To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BRIJESH6063/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook (credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb) to explore the project code and implement logistic regression for fraud detection.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
6. Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new credit card transactions, if desired.


## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate for training and testing the logistic regression model. Details about the dataset used are provided within the notebook.
